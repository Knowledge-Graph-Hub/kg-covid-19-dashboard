### KG-COVID-19 Project

The [KG-Covid-19](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-covid-19/) outputs a knowledge graph
that downloads and transforms COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 and related data and emits a knowledge graph that
can be loaded into KGX and used for machine learning or others uses, to produce actionable knowledge. 

#### Knowledge Graph Hub

A Knowledge Graph Hub (KG Hub) is software to download and transform data to a central location for
building knowledge graphs (KGs) from different combination of data sources, in an automated,
`YAML`-driven way. The workflow is:
- download data
- transform data for each data source into two TSV files (`edges.tsv` and `nodes.tsv`)
  as specified [here](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/blob/master/data-preparation.md)
- merge the graphs for each data source of interest using
  [KGX](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/) to produce a merged knowledge graph

To facilitate interoperability of datasets, 
[biolink](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/) [categories](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/category.html) are added to nodes and
[biolink](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/) [associations](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/Association)
are added to edges during transformation.

#####  The KG-hub pattern for data sharing
The pattern used in the KG-COVID-19 framework may be generally useful for data sharing
among scientific communities. In the KG-COVID-19 framework, each data source is transformed
and output as a separate graph, which is later combined with graphs for other data sources
according to the needs of the user. Although the subgraphs from the various data sources
(e.g., STRING, Drug Central) are produced locally by KG-COVID-19, our framework could
easily consume and incorporate graphs generated by other members of the community.
The exchange of data via a ‘KG-Hub’ would eliminate the duplication of effort that occurs
when researchers separately transform and prepare data, and might also facilitate the formation
of a data sharing portal for easier exchange of data.

#### Downloading the knowledge graph

A merged knowledge graph comprised of data from all available transforms is here:

[RDF](http://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-covid-19.nt.gz)

[TSV](http://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-covid-19.tar.gz)

See [here](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/blob/master/data-preparation.md) for a description
of the KGX TSV format.

#### Summary of data

A detailed, up-to-date summary of data can be programmatically retrieved from
[here](http://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/merged_graph_stats.yaml),
with contents of the knowledge graph broken down by biolink categories and biolink associations
for nodes and edges.  This file drives this dashboard.

We gratefully acknowledge the [Elsevier Coronavirus Information Center](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/coronavirus-information-center) for sharing their coronavirus pathway data, and also acknowledge and thank all COVID-19 data providers for making their data available. 

#### A few organizing principles
- UniprotKB IDs are used for genes and proteins when possible
- For drug/compound IDs, these IDs are preferred, in descending order of preference:
 CHEBI > CHEMBL > DRUGBANK > PUBCHEM
- Less is more: for each data source, we ingest only the subset of data that is most relevant
to the KG-Hub in question (here KG-COVID-19)
- We avoid ingesting data from a source that isn't authoritative for the data in question
 (e.g. do not ingest protein interaction data from a drug database)
- Each ingest should make an effort to add provenance data by adding a `provided_by` column in each
 edge TSV file, populated with the source of each datum
